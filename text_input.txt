About the role

We approach Data Science at Revolut the same way that we approach everything else. We take complex problems, and create extraordinary solutions that our customers love. Our Data Analysts arenâ€™t kept in the background, doomed to never see the impact of their work. Theyâ€™re some of our best and brightest problem solvers, deployed to the front-lines to work in Product Teams and deliver rock star solutions ðŸ¤˜

Weâ€™re looking for a superstar Data Analyst who does not believe there is a data task that can be too hard ðŸ¦¬ From digging into our complex databases, looking for the root cause of a problem to designing their own solutions and writing their own code to implement them. In this process they never stop learning, picking up new skills and delivering value âœ¨
